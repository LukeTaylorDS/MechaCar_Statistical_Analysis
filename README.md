# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
Statisitical analysis of MechaCar automobile performance

### Goals
Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Part 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Part 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
Part 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

## Resources
- Software: R, RStudio

## Analysis
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

We performed a linear regression analysis to predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes based on six variables. The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values were vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD. The slope of the linear model was not considered to be zero, and the coefficients for these variables were not equal to zero. However, the model only explained about 71% of the variance in the data, suggesting that other variables may be needed for more accurate predictions.
